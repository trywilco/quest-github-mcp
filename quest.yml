subtitle: Supercharge GitHub Copilot with the GitHub MCP Server and Agent Mode
description: >-
  Great job building the Quiz App! But now they're all submitting bug reports, 
  feature requests, and ideas at once... and it's overwhelming. Scale your response 
  by augmenting GitHub Copilot with the GitHub MCP Server and supercharging your 
  workflow using Agent Mode. Turn GitHub Copilot into a smart teammate that can 
  triage issues, research enhancements, and even generate code â€” all from within 
  your Codespace. Learn to set up and configure the GitHub MCP Server, use Copilot 
  Agent Mode + MCP to research similar projects and generate ideas, automatically 
  create and triage GitHub issues, implement solutions via Copilot, and responsibly 
  validate and merge AI-generated code.
